# debezium-oracle-kubernetes-without-operator

Using operator to deploy into microservices sometimes too much with much features we not used actually. So here we using kubernetes manifests only to keep it lean.
# Prerequisite
1. Installed kubernetes and docker
Here i used docker desktop with enabling kubernetes cluster by Preferences -> Kubernetes -> Enable Kubernetes -> Apply & restart, you also can using minikube, kubespray to provisioning kubernetes
